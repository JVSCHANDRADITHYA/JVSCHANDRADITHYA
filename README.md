Hi, I’m Chandradithya. I enjoy building systems end to end, from data pipelines to deployable models. Most of my work revolves around Applications, applied AI and computer vision, with a strong focus on robustness, scalability, and real-world constraints. I like working close to the system rather than never-gonna-use-this POC and demos.
